# [Light Bright](https://svelte.dev/repl/cef9541e26814afa8abdc2d84feecb42?version=3.12.1)

## Preface

This project was inspired by a [take-home project @freeCodeCamp](https://svelte.dev/repl/cef9541e26814afa8abdc2d84feecb42?version=3.12.1). Using only the REPL, I was able to create the basic functionalities behind the application, and in so doing I think I managed to create a rather teaching endeavor.

In addition to the live demo, you find here the files to run the project locally. These are retrieved directly from the REPL.

1. install packages

  ```code
  npm install
  ```

1. run the development environment
