# Icon Maker

The goal of this project is rather straightforward, but filled with potential: starting from the SVG syntax behind a vector icon, draw the shape with the Canvas API and [the Path2D interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Path2D), and allow to download the asset as a `.png` file.

Bonus points: allow to download the icon at any size.
