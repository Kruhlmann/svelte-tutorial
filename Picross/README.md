# Picross

## Goal

Recreate the basic structure of the semi-popular puzzle game which allows to draw stylized figures with blocks.

## Notes

This project is based on a previous experiment with the table element, in which I used JavaScript to plot a series of levels through columns, rows and cells of SVG elements. You can find the experiment [live here on codepen](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/MWgEbPz), but I've extracted the main logic in the **Table Levels** subfolder.
