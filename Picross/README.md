# Picross

## Goal

Recreate the basic structure of the semi-popular puzzle game which allows to draw stylized figures with blocks.

## Notes

This project is based on a previous experiment with the table element, in which I used JavaScript to plot a series of levels through columns, rows and cells of SVG elements. You can find the experiment [live here on codepen](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/MWgEbPz).

## res

In the **res** folder you find the building blocks behind the application:

-   in the **UI** folders you find the markup and stylesheet developed for the three stages of the application.
