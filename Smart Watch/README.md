# [Smart Watch](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/bGGWMBx)

## Goal

Create a series of independent applications for a hypothetical smart watch.

## Notes

This project is inspired by a gadget proposed in the pokemon game series, a smart watch with a plethora of applications. I set out to recreate a few of them to highlight the potential of a component-based approach.

I'm developing the application with the React framework as well, and this will allow me to consider the different approaches behind React and Svelte.

## res

In the **res** folder you find a series of sub-folders describing the building blocks behind the application and the different components. By dedicating separate files I was able to focus on the SVG syntax and final design without worrying too much about the functionality.
