# Smart Watch

## Goal

Create a series of independent applications for a hypothetical smart watch.

## Notes

This project is inspired by a gadget proposed in the pokemon game series, a smart watch with a plethora of applications. I set out to recreate a few of them to highlight the potential of a component-based approach.

I'm developing the application with the React framework as well, and this will allow me to consider the different approaches behind React and Svelte.
