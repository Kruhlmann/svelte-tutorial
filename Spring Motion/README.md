# [Spring Motion](https://svelte.dev/repl/27163986809341a5a7c97cbc4746d01b)

The `svelte/motion` module offers animation through the `tweened` and `spring` constructs. With this project, I take the example provided in the [tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/spring) for the `spring` store and build a silly animation with the SVG syntax recreating the icon of a bug. See `bug.svg` for a reference.
