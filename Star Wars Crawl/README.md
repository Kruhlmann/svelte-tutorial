## Goal

Create an interactive form allowing to edit and show the opening crawls from a Star Wars movie.

## Notes

This project begun while developing a toggle out of a light saber, and is deeply inspired by [this article @lemondefr](https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2019/12/18/star-wars-vous-voulez-davantage-d-episodes-generez-un-scenario-avec-notre-starwarsotron_6023326_4408996.html).

To develop the final result, a few smaller projects have been developed and saved in the **res** folder:

- the toggle, using SVG syntax ans CSS transition properties to show a blue-colored saber.

- the Star Wars title, redesigned from the first version first created for a React project.

- a playground to experiment with 3D transform properties. This project ultimately lead me to the markup and property value pairs necessary for the crawling animation.
