# Star Wars Crawl

## Goal

Create an interactive form allowing to edit and show the opening crawls from a Star Wars movie.

## Notes

This project begun while developing a toggle out of a light saber, and is deeply inspired by [this article @lemondefr](https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2019/12/18/star-wars-vous-voulez-davantage-d-episodes-generez-un-scenario-avec-notre-starwarsotron_6023326_4408996.html).

You can find the toggle in the **res** folder, using SVG syntax ans CSS transition properties to show the blue-colored saber.

In addition to this project, I also re-designed the "Star Wars" title I first designed for a separate React project. In the **res** folder I added this resource, and you can find its first version [on codesandbox](https://4p7l5.codesandbox.io/).

The Svelte Project

After much work.
I finally completed this nifty project.
Using 3D transform properties, a bit of perspective, and surprisingly enough, _not_ the transition directive.

Just a lovely CSS animation.
