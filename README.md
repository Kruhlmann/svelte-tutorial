# svelte-tutorial

## Preface

In this repo I set out to include _and hopefully_ explain a series of projects using [Svelte.js](https://svelte.dev).

## [Light Bright](https://svelte.dev/repl/cef9541e26814afa8abdc2d84feecb42)

A light-bright app inspired by a [take-home project](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/build-a-light-bright-app/) at [freeCodeCamp](freecodecamp.org). A perfect way to ease in the framework and explain basic concepts, directly in the [REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl).

**Tags**: getting started, repl, components, reactivity, events, dispatcher

## [Strongman](https://svelte.dev/repl/c234f8c4626440179c710f0c65cabfca)

A silly button allowing to raise a mallet and strike the puck of a carnival machine. Using SVG syntax, svelte reactivity and built-in motion functions.

**Tags**: reactivity, motion, spring, subscribe, tweened

## [Sport Bracket](https://svelte.dev/repl/4941cafa6eee409d947716816190222f)

Describe the eliminatory stages for a hypothetical sport competition, taking advantage of the `<svelte:self>` component.

**Tags**: self, store, custom store

## [Key Value Pairs](https://svelte.dev/repl/2fead853d94049e79805984858db9adb)

Create a CRUD application to add/update/delete key value pairs. Highlight the items through D3 and two visualizations.

**Tags**: bind, custom store, crud, d3

## [Stopwatch](https://svelte.dev/repl/591aff801e1d47498afdc2738fea4485)

Create an application allowing to track the passing of time and the lapse between laps.

**Tags**: setInterval, store, readable, animation, conditional statements

## [Word Frequency](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/QWWWqQM)

Elaborate the absolute frequency for every word included in a textarea element. Highlight the result through a table and a pie chart.

**Tags**: each, d3, fetch, animation

## [Wind Chill Index](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/WNNrrJg)

Compute the wind chill index on the basis of the input temperature and speed. Differentiate the result according to the chosen unit of measure.

**Tags**: form, dispatch, spread

## [Concentration](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/yLLVNME)

A memory-based game in which cards are flipped and matched in pairs.

**Tags**: utils, each, svg, transition

## [Infinity Maze](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/pooeyww)

An experiment with SVG syntax and the Aldous-Broder algorithm to create an endless game in which the player moves within the boundaries of a maze to reach a goal.

**Tags**: svg, algorithm, motion, grid, promise

## [Smart Watch](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/bGGWMBx)

Create a series of independent applications for a hypothetical smart watch.

**Tags**: svg, components

## [Picross](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/yLLPBMr)

Recreate the basic structure of the popular puzzle game which allows to draw stylized figures with a pixelated look.

**Tags**: svg, table, transition

## [Markdown Editor](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/VwwyGzR)

Create an online editor which allows to compose and preview markdown syntax.

**Tags**: markdown, markup, local storage

## [Tweet Component](https://svelte.dev/repl/2fd524fb5c7f427891269b4d0928ac15?version=3.12.1)

Create a reusable component to share a quote or even introduce an article.

## Typing Adventure

Expand from [this concept](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/bzpQLa) to create an application in which visitors are instructed to type a string.
