# svelte-tutorial

## Preface

In this repo I set out to include _and_ explain a series of projects built with [Svelte.js](https://svelte.dev).

## [Light Bright](https://svelte.dev/repl/cef9541e26814afa8abdc2d84feecb42?version=3.12.1)

A light-bright app inspired by a take-home project @freeCodeCamp. A perfect way to ease in the framework and explain basic concepts.
