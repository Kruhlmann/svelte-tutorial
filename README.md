# svelte-tutorial

## Preface

In this repo I set out to include _and_ explain a series of projects built with [Svelte.js](https://svelte.dev).

## To-dos

-   [ ] explain the light bright app through a post or video recording.

-   [ ] document the strongman application, and specifically the inclusion of the tweened and spring functions.

## [Light Bright](https://svelte.dev/repl/cef9541e26814afa8abdc2d84feecb42?version=3.12.1)

A light-bright app inspired by a [take-home project](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/build-a-light-bright-app/) at [freeCodeCamp](freecodecamp.org). A perfect way to ease in the framework and explain basic concepts, directly in the [REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl).

**Tags**: getting started, repl, components, reactivity, events, dispatcher

## [Strongman](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/XWrORQq)

A silly button allowing to raise a mallet and strike the puck of a carnival machine. Using SVG syntax, svelte reactive variables and built-in transitions.
