# [Basic Arithmetic](https://svelte.dev/repl/730b7da509b74438a9d1c4bc6306b52f)

## Goal

Compute basic arithmetic operations and animate the solution with a staggered animation.

## Notes

The project is rather straightforward, but allows to practice with a few features provided by Svelte (input binding, event dispatcher, keyed each blocks).

It was also a nice way to use CSS grid properties.

The font was picked following the suggestion from [goofonts](https://goofonts.com/tag/chalk), a website tagging Google fonts through a series of metrics.
