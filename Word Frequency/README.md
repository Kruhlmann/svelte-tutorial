# [Word Frequency](https://svelte.dev/repl/d047e6a494bc402a8897a25ae6c16725)

## DevNotes

-   the project was inspired by [this repo](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Word-Frequency-App.md)

-   I first developed a rough version through the online repl. You can find it [here](https://svelte.dev/repl/d047e6a494bc402a8897a25ae6c16725)

-   this project promises to be a great way to introduce essential concepts behind the framework, or compiler, that is svelte. Consider making a screencast developing the application one step at a time.

-   in the **res** folder you find the UI developed for the application. Considering the complexity of the layout, and the inclusion of svg icons, I decided to devote a different folder to the design.
