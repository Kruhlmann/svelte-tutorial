# [Typing Adventure](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/WNNaGKJ)

## Goal

Build upon the concept developed [in this pen](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/bzpQLa) to have an application tracking key strokes and their correctness against a provided string of characters.

## Notes

In the **UI** folder you find the UI(s) developed for the project. I experimented with [Splitting.js](https://splitting.js.org/) in order to animate the different parts of the application, and I believe I developed a rather robust design for the two states of the application. In the `README.md` file of this very folder you find a few notes behind the design itself.
