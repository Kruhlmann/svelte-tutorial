# [Typing Adventure](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/WNNaGKJ)

## Goal

Build upon the concept developed [in this pen](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/bzpQLa) to have an application tracking key strokes and their correctness against a provided string of characters.

## Notes

In the **UI** folder you find the UI(s) developed for the project. In here I designed the two screens of the application with [Splitting.js](https://splitting.js.org/), and I have a few notes about that journey in the `README` of that folder. Unfortunately, I wasn't immediately able to reuse the code in the `.svelte` files, and ended up creating my own "splitting component" to replicate the feat achieved by the library.
