# [Spring Rotation](https://svelte.dev/repl/952381e99df740498465cc53139c09aa)

Update an SVG with 3D transform properties and the spring module.

## Notes

This is a relatively smaller project, but it allows me to practice with the spring module provided by the Svelte compiler. It also makes use of the special element `<svelte:window>`, to consider the coordinates of the cursor relative to the entire viewport, and the `rotate3d` value for the `transform` property.

The graphic was designed for a different project using React, but I might end up re-creating the same effort with Svelte. For reference [here's a live demo of the React counterpart](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/PowJQew).
