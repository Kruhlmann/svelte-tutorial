# [Stopwatch](https://svelte.dev/repl/591aff801e1d47498afdc2738fea4485)

## Goal

Create an application allowing to track the passing of time and the lapse between laps.

## Notes

-   this project doesn't use degit, but relies instead on the folder provided by the [online REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl/)

-   the design is inspired by the stopwatch application pre-installed on my mobile;

-   the goal is to create a pull request to a popular repository, showcasing a functioning stopwatch app.
